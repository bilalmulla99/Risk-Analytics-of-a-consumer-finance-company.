The data contains the information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

The business objective is to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.
The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.
